# Hi, I’m Efe Dincaslan 👋

🎓 Cybersecurity Management & Analytics @ Virginia Tech (Pamplin College of Business)  
💼 Incoming Data Engineer Associate (LEAP) @ Fidelity Investments  
📍 Charlotte, NC  

I build **data-driven systems, analytics tools, and automation** that turn messy, real-world data into **clear, actionable insights**.  
My interests sit at the intersection of **data engineering, analytics, finance, and applied technology**.

---

## 🔍 What I Focus On
- Designing **end-to-end data workflows** (ingestion → processing → output)
- Building **Python-based analytics tools & APIs**
- Working with **real, imperfect datasets**
- Applying data to **business, financial, and operational decisions**

I care just as much about **clarity, structure, and usability** as I do about writing correct code.

## 🚀 Featured Work
Some highlights you’ll find in my pinned repositories below:

- **ChatDroid** – AI-powered chatbot platform for small businesses  
  End-to-end system design, API integrations, deployment, and UX considerations.(Repo is private because of OPENAI API Key)

- **ETF Portfolio Allocation Engine** – Rules-based investment allocation tool  
  Momentum/volatility scoring, financial logic, and data-driven decision rules.

- **Data Mining & Analytics Projects** – Comparative analysis & visualization  
  Pandas-based analysis with clear storytelling and visual outputs.

Each project is documented with **problem context, architecture, and results** — not just code.
